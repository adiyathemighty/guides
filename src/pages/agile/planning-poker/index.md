## Planning Poker
Planning poker is an estimation and planning technique in the Agile development model.

Each estimator holds poker cards with various values. The value represents the number of days, workforces, or any kind of estimation that managers want to meet in common. After the end of the discussion, each person selects a card which shows their estimation. Then they reveal it at the same time.

Things worth mentioning:
- Estimations are not comparable between teams, as every team has its own scala.
- Estimations should include everything that needs to be done in order for a piece of work to be done: designing, coding, testing, communicating, code reviews (+ all possible risks)
- The value of using planning poker is in the resulting discussions, as they reveal different views on a possible implementation
